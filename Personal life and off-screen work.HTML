<h1>Personal life and off-screen work</h1>
<p>Hiddleston lives in the Belsize Park area of north-west London. He has donated items for auction and has supported several charities, including the Small Steps Project, Starlight Children's Foundation, Cure EB, Comic Relief, Red Nose Day USA, Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Amnesty International and Chance to Shine.
He is a UK ambassador of the humanitarian and developmental assistance fund group UNICEF. He traveled to Guinea in early 2013 to raise awareness about hunger and malnutrition, and to South Sudan in early 2015 and late 2016 to report the results of the ongoing civil war on the lives of vast numbers of children across the country. Hiddleston identifies as a feminist. In February 2018 he was named as one of the donators by Justice and Equality Fund, the UK version of Time's Up movement. He is also an ambassador of the Illuminating BAFTA campaign, an action which aims to provide opportunities to those who otherwise wouldn't have been given a chance in the film, games and television industries.</p>

<p>Hiddleston was previously in a relationship with actress Susannah Fielding, who appeared with him in an episode of Wallander in 2008. Their relationship ended in late 2011. In 2016, Hiddleston dated American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift for several months.</p>
