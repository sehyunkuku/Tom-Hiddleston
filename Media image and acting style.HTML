<h1>Media image and acting style</h1>
<p>Hiddleston at the Japan premiere of Kong: Skull Island in 2017
One of the highest profile actors in contemporary British popular culture, Hiddleston appeared on Debrett's 2017 list of the most influential people in the UK. In 2015 he was named British Film Institute's first official founding ambassador. Hiddleston won the light-hearted UK award Rear of the Year 2016, in which the public nominate the male and female UK-based celebrities that they think should win the titular award. He has been named most stylish/best dressed man in several lists. Taffy Brodesser-Akner of GQ described his off-screen persona as "a sweet-natured bookworm given the face and body of the only man who should ever be allowed to wear a suit". Crimson Peak director Guillermo del Toro and comic book writer Stan Lee have called him "the nicest guy on earth/you'll ever meet" with del Toro adding that he ruined the usual barrier of being either nice, or good-looking.</p>

<p>Kenneth Branagh noted that the first time he ever saw Hiddleston, playing Cassio in Othello, it was quite clear to him that he was an utterly naturalistic speaker of Shakespeare. Michael Billington of The Guardian wrote that Hiddleston's key acting quality is "his ability to combine a sweet sadness with an incandescent fury, suggesting a fierce intellect gnawed by intense melancholy and yet subjecting to bouts of intemperate rage." Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times described Hiddleston as "an actor of uncommon intelligence and Pre-Raphaelite beauty." Hiddleston spent nearly five weeks preparing for the role of Hank Williams, performing seven of the movie's soundtrack songs. He has claimed that method acting is not easy for him because it does not help him as a collaborator. The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish suggested that Hiddleston "has got the theatrical acting chops to head up there among the greats", and The Independent's Paul Taylor said that "his range is beginning to look pretty limitless". David Fear of Rolling Stone opined that there are two sides to Hiddleston, the old-school movie star of Midnight in Paris, War Horse or The Night Manager, and the "unpredictable, borderline weirdo version" of him seen in characters like Loki or in High-Rise, adding that Hiddleston refuses to settle on one specific kind of role.</p>
